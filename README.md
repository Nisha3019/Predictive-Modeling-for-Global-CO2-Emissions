# Predictive-Modeling-for-Global-CO2-Emissions

**Project Overview**
The Global CO2 Emissions project aims to analyze and visualize trends in global CO2 emissions over time. The project leverages Python and data visualization libraries to provide insights into emission patterns, key contributors, and potential future trends. The goal is to support informed decision-making for environmental policies and sustainability efforts.

**Key Features**
    - Data Cleaning & Transformation: Ensured the dataset was clean, structured, and ready for analysis.
    - Data Analysis: Performed detailed data analysis to identify trends and patterns.
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key trends, patterns, and correlations.
    - Predictive Modeling:
        - KMeans Clustering – Identified emission patterns across countries.
        - ARIMA Model – Developed a predictive model to forecast future CO2 emissions.
    - Visualizations: Created interactive graphs and charts using Plotly and other visualization tools.
    - Insights & Predictions: Derived insights from historical data to predict future emission trends.
    - Correlation Analysis: Identified key factors influencing CO2 emissions.

**Datasets**
  - The dataset used for this project includes global CO2 emission data collected from Kaggle.com.

**Technologies and Libraries Used**
  - Python
  - Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
  - Pandas – Data Manipulation
  - NumPy – Numerical Operations
